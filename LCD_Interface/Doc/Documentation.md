# LCD Interface
Interfacing LCD 1602 using Nucleo STM32F446RE Board is a project that aims to display information on an LCD screen using an ARM controller. The project involves interfacing an LCD 1602 with a Nucleo STM32F446RE board using GPIO pins. The ARM controller sends data to the LCD screen through these GPIO pins, which is then displayed on the LCD screen.

The project is designed to help understand the working of GPIO pins and how they can be used to interface with external devices. The project uses the stm32 IDE to program the ARM controller.

The successful completion of this project demonstrates the ability to interface an LCD 1602 with an ARM controller using a Nucleo STM32F446RE board. The project can be extended to include more complex applications such as displaying sensor data on the LCD screen.

In this Documentation, we will discuss the methodology used to interface the LCD 1602 with the ARM controller, the hardware and software components of the project, and the results obtained. We will also discuss the potential applications of the project and its significance in the field of embedded systems.

## First : What is LCD 1602 How does it work 

The LCD 1602 is a commonly used alphanumeric liquid crystal display (LCD) module. It consists of 2 rows and 16 columns of characters, hence the name 1602. The module has a built-in controller that allows it to display characters, symbols, and even simple graphics.

+The LCD 1602 is widely used in various electronic applications, including embedded systems, hobby projects, and educational projects. Its low power consumption and ease of use make it a popular choice for displaying information.

+To interface with the LCD 1602, a microcontroller or other external device must send commands and data to the module through its pins. The module typically requires a voltage of 5 volts to operate, but some models can operate at lower voltages.

+Overall, the LCD 1602 is a versatile and useful display module that is commonly used in electronic projects for displaying information in a clear and easy-to-read format.

+The LCD 1602 display module typically has 16 pins, which are used to provide power, ground, and data connections. Here's a brief overview of the function of each pin:

1.***VSS (Ground)***:<br />
This pin is connected to ground (0V) and is used to provide a reference voltage for the module.

2.***VDD (Power)***:<br />
This pin is connected to a positive voltage (usually 5V) and is used to power the module.

3.***V0 (Contrast)*** :<br />
  This pin is used to adjust the contrast of the display. By varying the voltage applied to this pin, the contrast of the display can be adjusted.

4.***RS (Register Select)***:<br />
This pin is used to select whether data or command is being sent to the module. When this pin is low (0), the module expects a command. When it is high (1), the module expects data.

5.***RW (Read/Write)***: <br />
This pin is used to select whether data is being read from or written to the module. When it is low (0), data is being written to the module. When it is high (1), data is being read from the module.

6.***E (Enable)***: <br />
This pin is used to enable the module to receive commands or data.

7-14. ***D0-D7 (Data)***: <br /> 
These pins are used to send data to the module. When the RS pin is high, the data sent to these pins is displayed on the screen. When the RS pin is low, the data sent to these pins is interpreted as a command.

15.***A (Anode)***: <br />
This pin is used to backlight the display. It can be connected to a positive voltage to enable the backlight.

16.***K (Cathode)***:<br />
This pin is the ground connection for the backlight.
